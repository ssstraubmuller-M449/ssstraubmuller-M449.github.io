*I must make a clarifying note about this writing from St. John of Damascus. It points out several hypocrises and contradictions in islam, and should be read with those in mind. His tone is dismissive -- which I find distracting towards people who may be offended by the truth. Nevertheless, it is still a piece of writing worth reading to see the blatant contradictions in islam.

(Also, a note about the corruption of the Bible: <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript#Textual_criticism'>we literally have copies of the Bible from the time of Muhammad, and they are the same as they were from the time before Muhammad and of today. They all describe the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Christ -- in addition to Him stating He is the Son of God. </a>)
