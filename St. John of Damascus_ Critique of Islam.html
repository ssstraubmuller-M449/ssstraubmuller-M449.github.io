<h1>St. John of Damascus&#146;s Critique of Islam</h1>
<br/>

<p class="ai">Webmaster note: The following passage is from Saint John&#146;s monumental 
  work, the <em>Fount of Knowledge</em>, part two entitled <em>Heresies in Epitome: How They 
  Began and Whence They Drew Their Origin</em>. It is usually just cited as <em>Heresies</em>. 
  The translator&#146;s introduction points out that <em>Fount of Knowledge</em> is one 
  of the most &#147;important single works produced in the Greek patristic period,&#133;offering 
  as it does an extensive and lucid synthesis of the Greek theological science 
  of the whole period. It is the first great Summa of theology to appear in either 
  the East or the West.&#148; Saint John (+ 749) is considered one of the great 
  Fathers of the Church, and his writings hold a place of high honor in the Church. 
  His critique of Islam, or &#147;the heresy of the Ishmaelites,&#148; is especially 
  relevant for our times.</p>

<p>There is also the superstition of the Ishmaelites which to this day prevails 
  and keeps people in error, being a forerunner of the Antichrist. They are descended 
  from Ishmael, [who] was born to Abraham of Agar, and for this reason they are 
  called both Agarenes and Ishmaelites. They are also called Saracens, which is 
  derived from Sarras kenoi, or destitute of Sara, because of what Agar said to 
  the angel: &#145;Sara hath sent me away destitute.&#146; [99] These used to 
  be idolaters and worshiped the morning star and Aphrodite, whom in their own 
  language they called Khab&aacute;r, which means great. [100] And so down to 
  the time of Heraclius they were very great idolaters. From that time to the 
  present a false prophet named Mohammed has appeared in their midst. This man, 
  after having chanced upon the Old and New Testaments and likewise, it seems, 
  having conversed with an Arian monk, [101] devised his own heresy. Then, having 
  insinuated himself into the good graces of the people by a show of seeming piety, 
  he gave out that a certain book had been sent down to him from heaven. He had 
  set down some ridiculous compositions in this book of his and he gave it to 
  them as an object of veneration.</p>
<p>
  He says that there is one God, creator of all things, who has neither been begotten 
  nor has begotten. [102] He says that the Christ is the Word of God and His Spirit, 
  but a creature and a servant, and that He was begotten, without seed, of Mary 
  the sister of Moses and Aaron. [103] For, he says, the Word and God and the 
  Spirit entered into Mary and she brought forth Jesus, who was a prophet and 
  servant of God. And he says that the Jews wanted to crucify Him in violation 
  of the law, and that they seized His shadow and crucified this. But the Christ 
  Himself was not crucified, he says, nor did He die, for God out of His love 
  for Him took Him to Himself into heaven. [104] And he says this, that when the 
  Christ had ascended into heaven God asked Him: &#145;O Jesus, didst thou say: 
  &#147;I am the Son of God and God&#148;?&#146; And Jesus, he says, answered: 
  &#145;Be merciful to me, Lord. Thou knowest that I did not say this and that 
  I did not scorn to be thy servant. But sinful men have written that I made this 
  statement, and they have lied about me and have fallen into error.&#146; And 
  God answered and said to Him: &#145;I know that thou didst not say this word.&#148; 
  [105] There are many other extraordinary and quite ridiculous things in this 
  book which he boasts was sent down to him from God. But when we ask: &#145;And 
  who is there to testify that God gave him the book? And which of the prophets 
  foretold that such a prophet would rise up?&#146;&#151;they are at a loss. And 
  we remark that Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai, with God appearing in 
  the sight of all the people in cloud, and fire, and darkness, and storm. And 
  we say that all the Prophets from Moses on down foretold the coming of Christ 
  and how Christ God (and incarnate Son of God) was to come and to be crucified 
  and die and rise again, and how He was to be the judge of the living and dead. 
  Then, when we say: &#145;How is it that this prophet of yours did not come in 
  the same way, with others bearing witness to him? And how is it that God did 
  not in your presence present this man with the book to which you refer, even 
  as He gave the Law to Moses, with the people looking on and the mountain smoking, 
  so that you, too, might have certainty?&#146;&#151;they answer that God does 
  as He pleases. &#145;This,&#146; we say, &#145;We know, but we are asking how 
  the book came down to your prophet.&#146; Then they reply that the book came 
  down to him while he was asleep. Then we jokingly say to them that, as long 
  as he received the book in his sleep and did not actually sense the operation, 
  then the popular adage applies to him (which runs: You&#146;re spinning me dreams.) 
  [106]</p>
<p>
  When we ask again: &#145;How is it that when he enjoined us in this book of 
  yours not to do anything or receive anything without witnesses, you did not 
  ask him: &#147;First do you show us by witnesses that you are a prophet and 
  that you have come from God, and show us just what Scriptures there are that 
  testify about you&#148;&#146;&#151;they are ashamed and remain silent. [Then 
  we continue:] &#145;Although you may not marry a wife without witnesses, or 
  buy, or acquire property; although you neither receive an ass nor possess a 
  beast of burden unwitnessed; and although you do possess both wives and property 
  and asses and so on through witnesses, yet it is only your faith and your scriptures 
  that you hold unsubstantiated by witnesses. For he who handed this down to you 
  has no warranty from any source, nor is there anyone known who testified about 
  him before he came. On the contrary, he received it while he was asleep.&#146;</p>
<p>
  Moreover, they call us Hetaeriasts, or Associators, because, they say, we introduce 
  an associate with God by declaring Christ to the Son of God and God. We say 
  to them in rejoinder: &#145;The Prophets and the Scriptures have delivered this 
  to us, and you, as you persistently maintain, accept the Prophets. So, if we 
  wrongly declare Christ to be the Son of God, it is they who taught this and 
  handed it on to us.&#146; But some of them say that it is by misinterpretation 
  that we have represented the Prophets as saying such things, while others say 
  that the Hebrews hated us and deceived us by writing in the name of the Prophets 
  so that we might be lost. And again we say to them: &#145;As long as you say 
  that Christ is the Word of God and Spirit, why do you accuse us of being Hetaeriasts? 
  For the word, and the spirit, is inseparable from that in which it naturally 
  has existence. Therefore, if the Word of God is in God, then it is obvious that 
  He is God. If, however, He is outside of God, then, according to you, God is 
  without word and without spirit. Consequently, by avoiding the introduction 
  of an associate with God you have mutilated Him. It would be far better for 
  you to say that He has an associate than to mutilate Him, as if you were dealing 
  with a stone or a piece of wood or some other inanimate object. Thus, you speak 
  untruly when you call us Hetaeriasts; we retort by calling you Mutilators of 
  God.&#146;</p>
<p>They furthermore accuse us of being idolaters, because we venerate the cross, 
  which they abominate. And we answer them: &#145;How is it, then, that you rub yourselves against a stone in your Ka&#146;ba [107] and kiss and embrace 
  it?&#146; Then some of them say that Abraham had relations with Agar upon it, 
  but others say that he tied the camel to it, when he was going to sacrifice 
  Isaac. And we answer them: &#145;Since Scripture says that the mountain was 
  wooded and had trees from which Abraham cut wood for the holocaust and laid 
  it upon Isaac, [108] and then he left the asses behind with the two young men, 
  why talk nonsense? For in that place neither is it thick with trees nor is there 
  passage for asses.&#146; And they are embarrassed, but they still assert that 
  the stone is Abraham&#146;s. Then we say: &#145;Let it be Abraham&#146;s, as 
  you so foolishly say. Then, just because Abraham had relations with a woman 
  on it or tied a camel to it, you are not ashamed to kiss it, yet you blame us 
  for venerating the cross of Christ by which the power of the demons and the 
  deceit of the Devil was destroyed.&#146; This stone that they talk about is 
  a head of that Aphrodite whom they used to worship and whom they called Khab&aacute;r. 
  Even to the present day, traces of the carving are visible on it to careful 
  observers.</p>
<p>
  As has been related, this Mohammed wrote many ridiculous books, to each one 
  of which he set a title. For example, there is the book <em>On Woman</em>, [109] in which 
  he plainly makes legal provision for taking four wives and, if it be possible, 
  a thousand concubines&#151;as many as one can maintain, besides the four wives. 
  He also made it legal to put away whichever wife one might wish, and, should 
  one so wish, to take to oneself another in the same way. Mohammed had a friend 
  named Zeid. This man had a beautiful wife with whom Mohammed fell in love. Once, 
  when they were sitting together, Mohammed said: &#145;Oh, by the way, God has 
  commanded me to take your wife.&#146; The other answered: &#145;You are an apostle. 
  Do as God has told you and take my wife.&#146; Rather&#151;to tell the story 
  over from the beginning&#151;he said to him: &#145;God has given me the command 
  that you put away your wife.&#146; And he put her away. Then several days later: 
  &#145;Now,&#146; he said, &#145;God has commanded me to take her.&#146; Then, 
  after he had taken her and committed adultery with her, he made this law: &#145;Let 
  him who will put away his wife. And if, after having put her away, he should 
  return to her, let another marry her. For it is not lawful to take her unless 
  she have been married by another. Furthermore, if a brother puts away his wife, 
  let his brother marry her, should he so wish.&#146; [110] In the same book he 
  gives such precepts as this: &#145;Work the land which God hath given thee and 
  beautify it. And do this, and do it in such a manner&#148; [111]&#151;not to 
  repeat all the obscene things that he did.</p>
<p>
  Then there is the book of <em>The Camel of God</em>. [112] About this camel he says that 
  there was a camel from God and that she drank the whole river and could not 
  pass through two mountains, because there was not room enough. There were people 
  in that place, he says, and they used to drink the water on one day, while the 
  camel would drink it on the next. Moreover, by drinking the water she furnished 
  them with nourishment, because she supplied them with milk instead of water. 
  Then, because these men were evil, they rose up, he says, and killed the camel. 
  However, she had an offspring, a little camel, which, he says, when the mother 
  had been done away with, called upon God and God took it to Himself. Then we 
  say to them: &#145;Where did that camel come from?&#146; And they say that it 
  was from God. Then we say: &#145;Was there another camel coupled with this one?&#146; 
  And they say: &#145;No.&#146; &#145;Then how,&#146; we say, &#145;was it begotten? 
  For we see that your camel is without father and without mother and without 
  genealogy, and that the one that begot it suffered evil. Neither is it evident 
  who bred her. And also, this little camel was taken up. So why did not your 
  prophet, with whom, according to what you say, God spoke, find out about the 
  camel&#151;where it grazed, and who got milk by milking it? Or did she possibly, 
  like her mother, meet with evil people and get destroyed? Or did she enter into 
  paradise before you, so that you might have the river of milk that you so foolishly 
  talk about? For you say that you have three rivers flowing in paradise&#151;one 
  of water, one of wine, and one of milk. If your forerunner the camel is outside 
  of paradise, it is obvious that she has dried up from hunger and thirst, or 
  that others have the benefit of her milk&#151;and so your prophet is boasting 
  idly of having conversed with God, because God did not reveal to him the mystery 
  of the camel. But if she is in paradise, she is drinking water still, and you 
  for lack of water will dry up in the midst of the paradise of delight. And if, 
  there being no water, because the camel will have drunk it all up, you thirst 
  for wine from the river of wine that is flowing by, you will become intoxicated 
  from drinking pure wine and collapse under the influence of the strong drink 
  and fall asleep. Then, suffering from a heavy head after sleeping and being 
  sick from the wine, you will miss the pleasures of paradise. How, then, did 
  it not enter into the mind of your prophet that this might happen to you in 
  the paradise of delight? He never had any idea of what the camel is leading 
  to now, yet you did not even ask him, when he held forth to you with his dreams 
  on the subject of the three rivers. We plainly assure you that this wonderful 
  camel of yours has preceded you into the souls of asses, where you, too, like 
  beasts are destined to go. And there is the exterior darkness and everlasting 
  punishment, roaring fire, sleepless worms, and hellish demons.&#146;</p>
<p>
  Again, in the book of <em>The Table</em>, Mohammed says that the Christ asked God for 
  a table and that it was given Him. For God, he says, said to Him: &#145;I have 
  given to thee and thine an incorruptible table.&#146; [113]</p>
<p>
  And again, in the book of <em>The Heifer</em>, [114] he says some other stupid and ridiculous 
  things, which, because of their great number, I think must be passed over. He 
  made it a law that they be circumcised and the women, too, and he ordered them 
  not to keep the Sabbath and not to be baptized.</p>
<p>And, while he ordered them to eat some of the things forbidden by the Law, 
  he ordered them to abstain from others. He furthermore absolutely forbade the 
  drinking of wine.</p>
