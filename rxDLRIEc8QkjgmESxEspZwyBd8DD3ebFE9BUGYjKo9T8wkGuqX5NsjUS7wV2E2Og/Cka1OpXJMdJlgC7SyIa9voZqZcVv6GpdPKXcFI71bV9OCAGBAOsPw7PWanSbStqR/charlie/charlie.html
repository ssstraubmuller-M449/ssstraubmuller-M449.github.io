			<body>Why are these people guilty of the murder of Charlie Kirk? Charlie Kirk was murdered because we have become incapable of having proper discussion about things. We forget that people whom we talk to are made in the image of God, and we too often forget the inherit dignity that comes with that. It is an easy pitfall to stumble into. I have fallen into it. My friends have fallen into it. Many, many people in higher education fall into it. <b>Charlie Kirk did not fall into this trap.</b> He proclaimed what is verifiably true, that God loves us, that Christianity is real, and the teachings of our Lord. When we are created, we inherit the original wounds of our first parents -- this is why we have an inclination toward sin, and why we are not perfect. Those wounds are destroyed at baptism, but the effects of those wounds remain in this life. So many of us -- because we are never challenged -- never realize how broken we are, and how necessary it is to lean on Jesus and His Blessed Mother. So many of us think "morals are relative," or "good is only relative to what you were raised with," or something equivalent. <b>No. The fundamental truths about life have been revealed to us through the ministry of Jesus Christ.</b> So, why are these people guilty of the murder of Charlie Kirk? <b>They are guilty as I am guilty, and as we are guilty.</b> When we create division between ourselves to the point of calling each other nazis, when we compare the President of the United States to Adolf Hitler unjustly, when we refuse to accept the Truth that has been revealed to us solely so we may have eternal life, when we vehemently oppose everything somebody does because we don't want to face the uncomfortable Truth, we are doing exactly what led this terrorist to assassinate a young, brilliant, and kind leader in America.
