<h1> October 13th, 2025</h1>


<p> I am really tired of being in graduate school. </p>

<p> I love the teaching aspect of my job. It is a true blessing to be in a position to teach -- let alone teach math to the youth! But, I really dislike my classes.</p>

<p> I've reached the point where I now ask the question "when can I say enough is enough?" I look around my department and see poster after poster presenting mathematical problems, -- which sounds like a good thing, but I look closer and the problems are so niche, so specialized, so obscure that unless you know leagues of background information (that takes years to learn on top of graduate school) you can't even fully appreciate the poster! </p>

<p> I am a huge advocate of understanding theoretical concepts. I understand that knowing theory can (and will) save your hide in any problem you tackle -- from computational burden to writing logical arguments (and beyond!) -- but at some point, you just start doing math for the sake of doing math. There is no purpose for what you are doing. </p>

<p> Can you use mathematics to evangelize? Of course! It is a great evangelization tool! BUT! All that is necessary to prove the existence of God <u>has been proven already!</u> Chaos Theory might as well be the sixth Gospel (in addition to the typical four, and the Holy Land can be described as the fifth Gospel).</p>

<p> Are there unsolved questions in mathematics? Of course! BUT! Most are incredibly niche and unapplicable, some are computationally insane, and others just aren't very interesting.</p>

<p> This all ignores that my department is tying my hands and is obstructing my ability to effectively teach. It feels as though they try to fail as many students as possible so they can meet their budget! Their courses are designed to make students fail, and every time I try to make my students <u>actually think</u> I am told to stop.</p>

<p> Things have reached a boiling point when I designed a survey for the teaching seminar I am taking. I implemented best practices for data collection. I stressed that if we do not collect good data, we <u>will</u> draw bad conclusions. The feedback? Implement things that are the <b>DOOM</b> of good surveys. So, I did as I was told, and I stressed that the data scientist in me was strongly urging my professor to go with the first version. Yet, she chose to go a different path. I didn't really care because I thought it was just for my class (and as an informal check-in). But then, my professor says this survey will be used to collect data that will be <b>used to make decisions in the department.</b></p>

<p> First of all, we HAVE a data science section in our department! Why not use the resources at our disposal? It's like having a surgeon on-call and trying to complete an appendectomy on your own as a midwife. Could you do it? Sure! But it won't be pretty. Second, these are people who know firsthand that data collection matters! It is inexcusable to neglect proper data collection -- particularly when you are trying to improve something you know is broken!</p>

<p> At the end of the day, do I care? No. Does this bother me? Not really. I know in whom my dignity lies, and I know there are things more important in life. My prayer life has been pretty good, and I have been having good conversations with some priests and other people of the faith. They <u>all</u> have told me to stay the course, so I suppose I will continue -- even though I feel like I'm going to lose it by the end of the semester.</p>

<p> But whatever. I have all that I need through Jesus Christ, and I trust in His plan for me -- even if it means I mildly suffer now.</p>
